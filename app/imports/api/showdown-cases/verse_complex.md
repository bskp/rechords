1:
A [G]long, [D]long [Em]time ago
[Am]I can still re[C]member, how that [Em]music used to [D]make me smile
And [G]I knew if I [D]had my [Em]chance, that [Am]I could make those [C]people dance
and [Em]maybe they'd by [C]happy for a [D]while

But [Em]February [Am]made me shiver, with [Em]every paper [Am]I'd deliver
[C]Bad news [G]on the [Am]doorstep; I [C]couldn't take [D]one more step
I [G]can't re[D]member [Em]if I cried, when I [Am]read about his [D]widowed bride
[G]something [D]touched me [Em]deep inside, the [C]day the [D7]music [G]died[C]

Chorus:
So, [G]bye-[C]bye, Miss [G]American [D]Pie, drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the
[G]levee was [D]dry. Them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye, singing
[Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die, [Em]this'll be the day that I [D7]die

2: 
[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love, and do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above
If the [Em]Bible [D]tells you so?  Now do [G]you be[D]lieve in [Em]rock and roll
Can [Am]music save your [C]mortal soul?  And [Em]can you teach me how to [A7]dance real [D7]slow?

Well I [Em]know that you're in [Am]love with him, 'cause I [Em]saw you dancing [Am]in the gym
You [C]both [G]kicked off your [A7]shoes, man I [C]dig those rhythm and [D7]blues!
I was a [G]lonely [D]teenage [Em]bronching buck, with a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pick-up truck
But I [G]knew [D]I was [Em]out of luck the [C]day, the [D7]music [G]died
[G]I started [D7]singing...
